## How to we use Flare ?

Price feeds are essential to us because they ensure the accurate valuation of collateral, enabling secure and fair loan agreements.
To be respond to the requirements our protocol use FTSO **(Flare Time Series Oracle)**.

They allow us to dynamically manage risk and maintain the stability of our platform by adjusting to real-time market conditions.

Without reliable price feeds, we couldn't protect our users or our platform's integrity against the volatility inherent in crypto markets.
